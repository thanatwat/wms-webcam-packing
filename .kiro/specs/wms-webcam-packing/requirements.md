# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a web-based Warehouse Management System (WMS) application that enables video recording during order packing processes. The system allows warehouse staff to scan job packing barcodes, automatically record packing videos via webcam, upload recordings to Google Drive, and share video links with customers for transparency and quality assurance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want to view all pending orders in a centralized list, so that I can monitor packing workflow and assign tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Order List page loads THEN the system SHALL display all orders with status "waiting to be packed"
2. WHEN displaying orders THEN the system SHALL show order ID, customer information, items count, and priority level
3. WHEN an order status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time
4. IF no orders are pending THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a warehouse packer, I want to scan job packing barcodes to initiate video recording, so that I can document the packing process without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a barcode is scanned on the Job Pack Barcode Scan page THEN the system SHALL immediately activate the webcam
2. WHEN the webcam activates THEN the system SHALL start recording video automatically
3. WHEN the same job packing barcode is scanned again THEN the system SHALL record a new separate video
4. IF webcam access is denied THEN the system SHALL display an error message and request permission
5. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing recording status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a warehouse packer, I want videos to be automatically uploaded and job status updated, so that I can focus on packing without manual file management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video recording is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically upload the file to Google Drive
2. WHEN upload is successful THEN the system SHALL update the packer status to "Close Job Packing"
3. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry upload and notify the user of any persistent failures
4. WHEN job status is updated THEN the system SHALL log the timestamp and packer information
5. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue uploads for retry when connection is restored

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer service representative, I want to access all recorded videos with shareable links, so that I can provide customers with proof of proper packing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Video List page loads THEN the system SHALL display all recorded videos with metadata
2. WHEN displaying videos THEN the system SHALL show job ID, recording date, packer name, and video duration
3. WHEN a user clicks copy link THEN the system SHALL copy the shareable Google Drive link to clipboard
4. WHEN sharing a link THEN the system SHALL ensure the link provides appropriate viewing permissions
5. IF a video is still uploading THEN the system SHALL show upload progress status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure authentication and proper error handling, so that the system operates reliably in a production warehouse environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN Google Drive integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options
4. IF barcode scanning fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual job ID entry
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a warehouse packer, I want responsive video controls and quality settings, so that I can ensure proper documentation regardless of lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording video THEN the system SHALL provide stop recording functionality
2. WHEN webcam initializes THEN the system SHALL use optimal resolution and frame rate settings
3. WHEN lighting conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL adjust camera settings automatically
4. IF recording duration exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL automatically stop and save the video
5. WHEN multiple cameras are available THEN the system SHALL allow camera selection
